Thought I put this up.  I have been looking for bitmap fonts and thought of converting some old bdf formats to png.  Couldn't find anything that could do that except for this lone Ansi c file back in 2000.

I updated it to use png and it works good enough for me.  Doesn't support multi sized gliphs however and its not really a tokenizer but again, good enough.  Might expand it latter.
